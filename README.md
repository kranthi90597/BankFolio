npm install
```
### 4. Backend Setup
1. Import the backend project into Eclipse IDE.
2. Configure the database settings in the application.properties file:
```
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/bankingdb
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=root
```
3. Build the backend:
```
mvn clean install
